    - The level number on missions dooes not mean anything
        - The mission level is not an indicator to how easy that mission will be
        - Mission Grave difficulty indicator is also not a good indicator to how easy a mission will be
        - You will always be "under-leveled". This is normal, and you should not worry about the level number
