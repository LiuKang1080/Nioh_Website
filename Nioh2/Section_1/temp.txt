Website Requirements:

Website Dev:
    - HTML, CSS, and very little JavaScript.
    - Copy / paste existing HTML and CSS code to stay consistent with the rest of the site.
    - Explain mechanics and write up: tips, strategies, mechanics, how to play, and any other information regarding the game.
    
    - Booststrap, Skeleton CSS, and any other libraries for implementing responsive CSS.
    - Images and Tables do not properly fit on phone screens.
    - Images do not scale properly on resolutions greater than 1080p.

Image Editing:
    - (I am currently working on learning GIMP for photo editing.)
    - Edit, scale, crop, and render images. (GIMP / Photoshop)
    - Ex) starred effects --> edit the image to get just the star --> render just the star image --> use the image in multiple
        locations on the website.
    
Video Editing:
    - Create and render videos for general video and GIF creation. (Adobe After Effects or Sony Vegas Video Editing)
    - Record gameplay --> edit video --> render video --> convert video into GIF using Gifycat
    - FULL 1080p 60FPS
    - Ex) Record Gozuki triple attack --> render the video --> convert video into GIF --> embed the GIF into the HTML on the
        specific Gozuki boss page.

Misc:
    - For both Image Editing, and Video Editing: CONSISTENCY IS KEY!!!
    - Consistency in terms of resolution, and quality.

    - Need a central location for the videos, images, and GIFs. Videos on YT will be fine. GIFs on gifycat is fine, but need to
        ORGANIZE. Images on imgur will work well, again need to ORGANIZE the images. 
    - If we have a bunch of GIFs and images spread throughout multiple people on multiple accounts on different sites will make
        it very difficult to manage the data. We can make a google doc that holds the information about the links (like a 
        database).
